# Call for Proposals (CFP)

Sessions at FOSS United events are usually selected from a pool of proposals.
After the event is announced, the event organizers usually request the
Community to submit proposals e.g. talk proposals, workshop proposals. As the
scheduled date of the event approaches, the organizers choose the final sessions
from the submitted proposals with help from reviewers.

**NOTE:** Submitting a proposal to a FOSS United event does not require you to
have a Profile.

## Submit a Proposal

- In order to submit a proposal for a FOSS United event, visit the
  `"Talk Proposal"` tab on the event page and click on the
  `"Submit a talk proposal"` green button.

  the form.

## Update a Proposal

You can access submitted proposals from the `"Talk proposal"` tab of the
event. You might want to update the submitted proposal e.g. based on review
comments from the event organizers. You can either use the `"Edit CFP"` button
on this page or on the page that displays information about your proposal.
